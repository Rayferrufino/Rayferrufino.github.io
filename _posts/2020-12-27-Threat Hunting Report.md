To start off on any investigation I like to just do a quick Google search to see if anyone else has looked at the same thing. A good number of times this will help speed up an investigation, additionally it provides some already timestamped and openly available information that can be shared with a provider.

A quick search of the provided URL returns multiple resources mentioning it exactly. The best part here is these are hits on the exact URL we are looking for.
