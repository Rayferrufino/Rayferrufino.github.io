## very useful for escaping jail shells and when you're dealing with unstable ones too.

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```
```perl
echo os.system('/bin/bash')
```
```perl
/bin/sh -i
```
```perl
perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```
```perl
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
```
```perl
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```
```perl
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```
```perl
