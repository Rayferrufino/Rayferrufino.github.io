# NIST Forensic Toolkit

- **Digital Forensinc Workstation**
- **Forensinc Investigation suite or Forensic software**
- **Writeblockers**
- **Forensic drive duplicators**
- **Wiped drives and wiped remoable media**
- **Cables and adapters**
- **Camera**
- **Labeling documenting tools**
- **Chain-of-custody forms, notebooks and checklists.***

# Forensic Software

|Forensic Suites|
|---------------|
|FTK Access Data|
|EnCase|
|Caine|
|Autopsy|
|SIFT|

|Tools|
|-----|
|DumpIt|
|Memoryze|
|dd|
|WinDbg|

# Imaging Media and Drives
Forensinc images match exactly the original source drive, volume, partition, or device. including Slack space and unallocated space.
Slack space is the space left when a file is written.
Unallocated space is space that has not been partitioned.

## Analysis Utilities
- Timelines of systems changes
- Validation tools that check known good version of files against those found on a system.
- File analysis capabilities that can look at filesystem metadata (MASTER FILE TABLE FOR NTFS) to identify changes, access and deletions.
- Windows Registry analysis
- Log file parsing and review

Live memory capture analysis
Memory dump analysis is use when recovering decryption keys for full disk encryption products like Bitlocker
Hibernation files and crash dumps can both contain the data needed to decrypt the drive

# The Forensic Process
1. Determine what are you trying to find out
2. Outline the location and types of data that would help you answer step 1
3. Document and review your plan.
4. Acquire and preserve evidence
5. Perform initial analysis.
6. Use initial analysis to guide further work.
7. Report on the findings of the investigation.

# Target Locations

|Windows|Use|
|-------|---|
|Windows Registry| Information about files and services, locations of deleted files, evidence of applications being run|
|Autorun Keys| Programs set to run at startup (often associated with malware or compromised)|
|Master File Table| Details of inactive/removed records|
|Event logs| Logins,services start/stop/, evidence, of applications being run|
|Volume Shadow copy| Point in time information from prior actions|
|User directory and files| logged-in users artifacts|
|Recycle Bin| Files that were intended to be deleted but forgotten|
|Hibernation files and memory dumps| Memory artifacts of commands to run|
|Removable drives| System logs may indicates drives were plugged in|

# Imaging Live Systems
When dealing with  full disk encryption, malware, an image may need to be collected while the system is running.
Live imaging may not obtaion some desirable data:
- Can leave remnants due to the imaging utility being mounted from a removable driver.
- The contents of a drive or memory may change during the imaging proccess.
- Malware or other software may be able to detec the imaging tool and could take action to avoid it or disable it.
- live images tipically do not include unallocate space.

# USB Historian Tool

# Memory Capture
 FMEN and LiME, linux modules that allow access to physical memory. FMEN is designed to be used with dd.
 DumpIt, a windows memory capture tool that simply copies a system's physical memory to the folder where the DumpIt program is.
 The Volatility Framework supports a broad range of operating systems. including windows, Linux, and MacOS.
 FTK and EnCase have built-in memory capture tools.

# Core Dump and Hibernation Files
Contain the contents of live memory, they can include data that might otherwise be accessible on the drive of the system, such as #### memory-resident encryption keys ormalware that runs only on memory.Ex. ```%SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP```

# Mobile Device AcquisitionsThere are four primary modes of data acquisition:
Physical, SIM card, emory card, backups
Logical, requires forensic tool to create an logical image of the device
Manual access, unlocked phones, and taking pictures and notes.
Filesystem, deleted files as well exiting directories.
